MongoDB briefings in database collections and documents logic. 
This means we have a database which can contain one or multiple collections
and the collections can contain one or multiple documents.

and in our project each single document is a new place that we stored, That is a mongDB side ..

from mongoose side we think in schema and model logic a schema is the blueprint of a documents
that we want to store . in our case blueprint of a place for example we can make sure that 
a place must contain a title.

Based on the schema we create model and each instance of this model in our code will then result in a new document.

//start with mongoDB create place.js in models folder


bcryptjs this is a nodejs library that helps us craete secure password or not create password but hash password , encrypt password


JWT jsonwebtoken 
this is a package which allow us to genetate such tokens with that private key
 we have to make sure to use the same key for example 'supersecret_dont_share' in login and in sign up
